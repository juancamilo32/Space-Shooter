# Space Shooter

Galaxy Shooter is a simple top-down 2d shooter where enemy ships constantly spawn from the top of the screen. Your goal is to destroy them with your lasers to gain points, but watch out! These enemies also have lasers of their own. Fortunately for you, you might find a couple of power-ups during your journey to make it a bit easier.
